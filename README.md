# Markx


## About this folk

Simply compatible with python 3

### Markdown editor for scientific writing. Batteries included.

## Why Markx?
Markdown has recently become popular among academics as a way to produce scientific documents.
When paired with document conversion engines such as pandoc, it provides an easy and powerful way to write.
Being a simple plain-text markup language, Markdown is easy to learn, and can be handled by version control systems.
We decided to build Markx as to make markdown writing a collaborative effort that could be hosted as web service.
For additional discussion, see these blog posts:

* [Markdown and the future of collaborative academic writing](http://inundata.org/2012/06/01/markdown-and-the-future-of-collaborative-manuscript-writing/)
* [Thoughts on a preprint server](http://inundata.org/2012/12/06/pre-print-servers/)

## Features

1. Free as in free speech - promotes open science, pre-publication review, collaboration.
1. Free as in free beer - uses open-source, free software and released under [CC-NC-BY 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/).
1. Easy to learn - [Markdown] is not LaTex, for better and worse.
1. Integration with [GitHub] - free hosted version control, ideal for backup, versioning and collaboration.
1. [Pandoc] integration - multiple Markdown extensions, multiple output formats.
1. Real-time Markdown preview - [WYSIWYM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYM) / [WYSIWYG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG).
1. Display math with LaTeX formatting - $x^2+y^2=r^2$.
1. Citations - [BibTeX]: [@Drake1991]
1. Code highlighting:

		if __name__ == '__main__':
		    # Bind to PORT if defined, otherwise default to 5000.
		    port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 5000))
		    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=port, debug=app.debug)
1. Local host option with a limited number of dependencies - for offline editing on the train and in the airplane
1. Remote host option at <http://markx.herokuapp.com/> - no installation required
1. By scientists, for scientists

## Development Status

Markx is currently in development but can be used locally (see Installation instructions below) or remotely at <http://markx.herokuapp.com>.

It is still experimental, so **take care of your data!**
